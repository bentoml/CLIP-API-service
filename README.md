## üìñ Introduction üìñ
[CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip), or Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining, is a cutting-edge AI model that comprehends and connects text and images, revolutionizing how we interpret online data.

This library provides you with an instant, easy-to-use interface for CLIP, allowing you to harness its capabilities without any setup hassles. BentoML takes care of all the complexity of serving the model!

## üîß Installation üîß
Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or newer and `pip` installed on your system. We highly recommend using a Virtual Environment to avoid any potential package conflicts.

To install the service, enter the following command:
```bash
pip install clip-api-service
```

## üèÉ Quick start üèÉ

Once the installation process is complete, you can start the service by running:
```bash
clip-api-service serve --model-name=ViT-B-32:openai
```
Your service is now running! Interact with it via the Swagger UI at `localhost:3000`

Or try this tutorial in Google Colab: [CLIP demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bentoml/CLIP-API-service/blob/main/example/clip_demo.ipynb).

## üéØ Use cases üéØ
Harness the capabilities of the CLIP API service across a range of applications:

### Encode
1. Text and Image Embedding
    - Use `encode` to transform text or images into meaningful embeddings. This makes it possible to perform tasks such as:
        1. **Neural Search**: Utilize encoded embeddings to power a search engine capable of understanding and indexing images based on their textual descriptions, and vice versa.
        2. **Custom Ranking**: Design a ranking system based on embeddings, providing unique ways to sort and categorize data according to your context.

### Rank
2. Zero-Shot Image Classification
    - Use `rank` to perform image classification without any training. For example:
        1. Given a set of images, classify an image as being "a picture of a dog" or "a picture of a cat".
        2. More complex classifications such as recognizing different breeds of dogs can also be performed, illustrating the versatility of the CLIP API service.

3. Visual Reasoning
    - The `rank` function can also be used to provide reasoning about visual scenarios. For instance:

| Visual Scenario | Query Image | Candidates | Output |
|-----------------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Counting Objects | ![Three Dog](images/three-dog.jpg) | This is a picture of 1 dog<br>This is a picture of 2 dogs<br>This is a picture of 3 dogs | Image matched with "3 dogs" |
| Identifying Colors | ![Blue Car](images/bluecar.jpeg)  | The car is red<br>The car is blue<br>The car is green | Image matched with "blue car" |
| Understanding Motion | ![Parked Car](images/parkedcar.jpeg)  | The car is parked<br>The car is moving<br>The car is turning| Image matched with "parked car" |
| Recognizing Location | ![Suburb Car](images/car-suburb.jpeg)  | The car is in the suburb<br>The car is on the highway<br>The car is in the street| Image matched with "car in the street" |
| Relative Positioning | ![Big Small car](images/big-small-car.jpg) | The big car is on the left, the small car is on the right<br>The small car is on the left, the big car is on the right| Image matched with the provided description |
 

## üöÄ Deploying to Production üöÄ
Effortlessly transition your project into a production-ready application using [BentoCloud](https://www.bentoml.com/bento-cloud/), the production-ready platform for managing and deploying machine learning models.

Start by creating a BentoCloud account. Once you've signed up, log in to your BentoCloud account using the command:

```bash
bentoml cloud login --api-token <your-api-token> --endpoint <bento-cloud-endpoint>
```
> Note: Replace `<your-api-token>` and `<bento-cloud-endpoint>` with your specific API token and the BentoCloud endpoint respectively.

Next, build your BentoML service using the `build` command:

```bash
clip-api-service build --model-name=ViT-B-32:openai
```

Then, push your freshly-built Bento service to BentoCloud using the `push` command:

```bash
bentoml push <name:version>
```

Lastly, deploy this application to BentoCloud with a single `bentoml deployment create` command following the [deployment instructions](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/reference/cli.html#bentoml-deployment-create).

BentoML offers a number of options for deploying and hosting online ML services into production, learn more at [Deploying a Bento](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/concepts/deploy.html).

### API reference
#### `/encode`
Accepts either:
* `img_uri` : An Image URI, i.e `https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dog-puppy-on-garden-royalty-free-image-1586966191.jpg`
* `text` : A string
* `img_blob` : Base64 encoded string

Returns a vector of embeddings of length 768.

**Example:**
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/encode' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[

```

#### `/rank`
Accepts a list of `queries` and a list of `candidates`. Similar to above, `queries` and `candidates` are either:
* `img_uri` : An Image URI, i.e `https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dog-puppy-on-garden-royalty-free-image-1586966191.jpg`

Returns a list of probabilies and cosine similarities of each candidate with respect to the query.

**Example:**
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/rank' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "queries": [
    {
      "img_uri": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dog-puppy-on-garden-royalty-free-image-1586966191.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": [
    {
